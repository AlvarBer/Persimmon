abstract: >
    Persimmon is a visual programming interface that leverages scikit-learn to
    provide a drag and drop interface for developing Machine Learning and
    Data Mining pipelines. It is based on the dataflow programming principles,
    giving the user a functional visual language with a type safety system that
    checks connections at write time, non-strict evaluation, task
    parallelization, and execution visualization. It has been evaluated by
    participants on a three-task form, overall receiving good
    reviews, being praised by the use of colors to indicate types, consistent
    design, easy to navigate and shallow learning curve.
